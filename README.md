> 👋 My journey with computers started at 5 years old when my mom bought me my first Windows XP computer. With it, I began tinkering and developed an increasing interest in the world of tech. Later, I started using and creating server plugins and mods for Minecraft, as well as tinkering with Linux and open-source software.
